#Reducing noise in protein multialignments
● Remove the noise in the test data i.e. sequences alignment of proteins, 
● Evaluate its performance by calculating the symmetric difference between test data (the original alignments) and reference tree, filtered data and reference tree respectively.
● Analyze the results and conclude that it is not worthwhile to use multialignment noise reduction
